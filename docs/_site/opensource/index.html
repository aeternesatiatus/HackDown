<h1 id="open-source-licenses">Open-source licenses</h1>

<p>Most people are not aware of almost content creator have to know everyday: what is <em>open-source</em>.
These same people happen to be the ones who only have one computer with Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office…
Now, we will explain to you what it is.</p>

<h2 id="meaning">Meaning</h2>
<p>Open-source means that the published content, whether it’s a:</p>
<ul>
  <li>video</li>
  <li>image</li>
  <li>music</li>
  <li>software</li>
</ul>

<p>has been created by someone who chose to waive some of his rights over their creation, notably their right to control how their content is being distributed or reused for other purposes.
So, following the terms of the open-source license, you could have the right to use that same content without being prevented of doing so.
Of course, it depends on what that particular license allows you to do.</p>

<p>There are general licenses and specific licences, tailored to every type of content and your own needs.
For example, you could only allow sharing or you could authorize anyone to reuse your content, even for commercial reasons.
