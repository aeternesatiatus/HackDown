## DNS over HTTPS - What is it?

### Introduction

As you might know it, the Internet works with some kind of phone book we call the Domain Name System, a system that connects a domain name with an IP address associated with it. 
Otherwise, nobody would ever remember how to connect to a website, acknowledging remembering IP addresses is hard, including common websites as Google or Facebook.

The big problem is that many organizations including the government, Internet Service Providers and many technological companies have full access on what you are seaching on the Internet, since DNS requests are unprotected and can be intercepted.
For example, ISPs like Comcast and Verizon in the USA did intercept DNS requests and redirected them to their own content, as everything is in ClearText.

Therefore, many cryptographers and web developers decided to unite themselves to counteract those problems, introducing **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)**, also known as DNS-over-TLS, to supplement the old insecure DNS.

What does it do? As with websites and the HTTPS protocol, it encrypts communications between the client, the DNS Nameserver and the server, but here, it encrypts DNS requests.
Therefore, nobody would ever know what you visited when browsing the Internet, except of course us and third parties if it's the case, like your DNS provider.
Anyone controlling an Internet server relay would be unable to access their connection history with **your data** because they would see encrypted garble.

### Configuration

However, these services are very uncommon even though they are free, transparent and open-source:
- DNSCrypt (set up your own DNS resolver that supports DNS-over-HTTPS)
- Cloudflare DNS (set up your network adapter to work with DNS 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 with TRR Record https://mozilla.cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query)
- Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8. et 8.8.4.4 with TRR record https://dns.google.com/experimental)

Currently, only the developer versions of Chrome and Firefox support DNS over HTTPS, requiring advanced technical knowledge.
